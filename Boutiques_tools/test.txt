Usage:    bet <input> <output> [options]

Main bet2 options:
  -o          generate brain surface outline overlaid onto original image
  -m          generate binary brain mask
  -s          generate approximate skull image
  -n          don't generate segmented brain image output
  -f <f>      fractional intensity threshold (0->1); default=0.5; smaller values give larger brain outline estimates
  -g <g>      vertical gradient in fractional intensity threshold (-1->1); default=0; positive values give larger brain outline at bottom, smaller at top
  -r <r>      head radius (mm not voxels); initial surface sphere is set to half of this
  -c <x y z>  centre-of-gravity (voxels not mm) of initial mesh surface.
  -t          apply thresholding to segmented brain image and mask
  -e          generates brain surface as mesh in .vtk format

Variations on default bet2 functionality (mutually exclusive options):
  (default)   just run bet2
  -R          robust brain centre estimation (iterates BET several times)
  -S          eye & optic nerve cleanup (can be useful in SIENA)
  -B          bias field & neck cleanup (can be useful in SIENA)
  -Z          improve BET if FOV is very small in Z (by temporarily padding end slices)
  -F          apply to 4D FMRI data (uses -f 0.3 and dilates brain mask slightly)
  -A          run bet2 and then betsurf to get additional skull and scalp surfaces (includes registrations)
  -A2 <T2>    as with -A, when also feeding in non-brain-extracted T2 (includes registrations)

Miscellaneous options:
  -v          verbose (switch on diagnostic messages)
  -h          display this help, then exits
  -d          debug (don't delete temporary intermediate images)

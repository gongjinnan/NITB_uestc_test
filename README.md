# NITB_uestc_test
The function (Example\_to\_docker\_v2.m and itâ€™s depending FSL matlab toolbox) was compiled by using the Matlab 2015b in Linux(fn). 
'' mcc -m Example_to_docker_v2.m
This function can report the central value of an MRI image, and output somethings to a text file.
I want to test serval things in this function
1. Basically, is that possible to run a Matlab function (compiled) with user-input parameters (inputniifile, outputtxt in this case)
2. Does it work for calling a function of FSL to read nii image (read\_avw for an instance)
3. Does it work for multi-language ( It seems not working)
4. Is that possible to call system console( for example : echo, bet et al.)
